# Scripting Language Lab

Welcome to the Scripting Language Lab repository! This repository contains a collection of experiments designed to help you master web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Experiments

### Experiment 2: JavaScript Form Validation
This experiment focuses on creating a registration form with various fields and validating these fields using JavaScript. The fields to be validated include:

- **Name**: Must contain only alphabets and be at least 6 characters long.
- **Password**: Must be at least 6 characters long.
- **Email ID**: Must follow the standard email format (name@domain.com).
- **Phone Number**: Must contain exactly 10 digits.

#### Description

JavaScript is a versatile scripting language used in web browsers to create dynamic web pages. It enables the modification of HTML and CSS, allowing for interactive and responsive web designs. Regular expressions in JavaScript are powerful tools for pattern matching, making them ideal for form validation.

### Experiment 3: CSS Styling Techniques
This experiment demonstrates the usage of inline, internal, and external CSS to style HTML elements. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation of web pages, allowing for enhanced design and layout capabilities.

#### Description

CSS is essential for creating visually appealing web pages. It allows developers to apply styles, animations, and responsive designs efficiently. This experiment covers three types of CSS:

- **Inline CSS**: Applied directly within HTML elements using the `style` attribute.
- **Internal CSS**: Defined within a `<style>` tag inside the `<head>` section of an HTML document.
- **External CSS**: Stored in a separate `.css` file and linked to the HTML document.

## Lessons Learned

Through these experiments, students will learn:

- How to validate form inputs using JavaScript and regular expressions.
- The importance of input validation for user data security and integrity.
- Different methods to apply CSS styles and their respective use cases.
- The benefits and drawbacks of inline, internal, and external CSS.

## Skills Acquired

By completing these experiments, students will acquire the following skills:

- Proficiency in using JavaScript for client-side validation.
- Understanding and application of regular expressions.
- Ability to create and link CSS files for styling web pages.
- Knowledge of best practices in web design and development.
