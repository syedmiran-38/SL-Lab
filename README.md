# Scripting Language Lab

Welcome to the Scripting Language Lab repository! This repository contains a collection of experiments designed to help you master web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Experiments

### Experiment 2: JavaScript Form Validation
This experiment focuses on creating a registration form with various fields and validating these fields using JavaScript. The fields to be validated include:

- **Name**: Must contain only alphabets and be at least 6 characters long.
- **Password**: Must be at least 6 characters long.
- **Email ID**: Must follow the standard email format (name@domain.com).
- **Phone Number**: Must contain exactly 10 digits.

#### Description

JavaScript is a versatile scripting language used in web browsers to create dynamic web pages. It enables the modification of HTML and CSS, allowing for interactive and responsive web designs. Regular expressions in JavaScript are powerful tools for pattern matching, making them ideal for form validation.

### Experiment 3: CSS Styling Techniques
This experiment demonstrates the usage of inline, internal, and external CSS to style HTML elements. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation of web pages, allowing for enhanced design and layout capabilities.

#### Description

CSS is essential for creating visually appealing web pages. It allows developers to apply styles, animations, and responsive designs efficiently. This experiment covers three types of CSS:

- **Inline CSS**: Applied directly within HTML elements using the `style` attribute.
- **Internal CSS**: Defined within a `<style>` tag inside the `<head>` section of an HTML document.
- **External CSS**: Stored in a separate `.css` file and linked to the HTML document.

### Experiment 4: JavaScript Popup Boxes
This experiment consists of four parts, each demonstrating different uses of JavaScript popup boxes: Alert, Confirm, and Prompt.

#### Part 1: Display Date in Textbox
This part focuses on displaying the current date in a textbox when a button is clicked.

**File name**: `display_date.html`

#### Description

JavaScript provides the ability to manipulate date and time. In this experiment, we create a function that retrieves the current date and displays it in a textbox when a button is clicked.

#### Part 2: Factorial Calculation
This part calculates the factorial of a number provided by the user through a prompt and displays the result using an alert box.

**File name**: `factorial.html`

#### Description

JavaScript can perform arithmetic operations and control structures like loops. In this experiment, a prompt is used to get a number from the user, and a loop calculates its factorial, which is then displayed using an alert box.

#### Part 3: Multiplication Table
This part generates a multiplication table for a number provided by the user and displays the result using an alert box.

**File name**: `multiplication_table.html`

#### Description

JavaScript loops are useful for repetitive tasks. Here, a prompt is used to get a number, and a loop generates its multiplication table, displaying the results in an alert box.

#### Part 4: Sum of n Numbers Using Popup Boxes
This part calculates the sum of a series of numbers provided by the user through a series of prompts and displays the result using an alert box.

**File name**: `sum_of_numbers.html`

#### Description

JavaScript's ability to handle user input through prompts and confirm boxes is showcased in this experiment. Users are prompted to enter numbers, and they can choose to continue entering numbers or stop. The sum of all entered numbers is displayed using an alert box.


### Experiment 5: Country and Capital Selection
This experiment creates an HTML page with a selection box containing a list of 5 countries. When a user selects a country, its capital is displayed next to the list. CSS is used to customize the properties of the font of the capital (color, bold, and font size).

**File name**: `countries.html`

#### Description

The `<select>` element is used to create a drop-down list in HTML. It is commonly used in forms to collect user input. The `<option>` tags inside the `<select>` element define the available options in the drop-down list. In this experiment, JavaScript is used to display the capital of a selected country in a styled manner using CSS.

### Experiment 6: Number to Words Conversion
This experiment creates an HTML page that allows users to input a number and converts the number to its word representation. The result is displayed with customized font properties using CSS.

**File name**: `number_to_words.html`

#### Description

JavaScript can be used to perform various transformations and calculations on data input by users. In this experiment, an HTML page is designed with a text input for numbers and a button to trigger the conversion. JavaScript is used to convert the number into words, and CSS is used to style the resulting text. The conversion handles numbers up to 3 digits and displays them in a formatted manner.

### Experiment 7: PHP Sum of Digits and Palindrome Check
This experiment includes two parts: one that calculates the sum of digits of a number and another that checks if a number is a palindrome using PHP.

**File name**: `sum_and_palindrome.php`

#### Description

PHP is a server-side scripting language used for web development. This experiment demonstrates two common operations in PHP:

- **Sum of Digits**: The first part calculates the sum of digits of a given number. This is done by extracting each digit using a loop and summing them up.
- **Palindrome Check**: The second part checks whether a given number is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. The function reverses the number and compares it to the original to determine if it is a palindrome.

## Lessons Learned

Through these experiments, students will learn:

- How to validate form inputs using JavaScript and regular expressions.
- The importance of input validation for user data security and integrity.
- Different methods to apply CSS styles and their respective use cases.
- The benefits and drawbacks of inline, internal, and external CSS.
- How to manipulate dates and perform arithmetic operations in JavaScript.
- Using prompts and alerts to interact with users and display results.
- Creating interactive and dynamic web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Converting numbers to their word representations using JavaScript.
- Performing common operations in PHP, such as summing digits and checking for palindromes.
